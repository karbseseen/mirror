A media player made with Qt and libvlc which lets you watch videos and listen to music on several computers simultaneously. It synchronizes play, pause and seek. The source file needs to be stored only on one device because the data is sent via the internet by Pyipv8 library. Works via both local and global network. Has the ability to select from multiple audio and subtitle tracks. Has been tested on Windows and Linux and probably works on Mac.
